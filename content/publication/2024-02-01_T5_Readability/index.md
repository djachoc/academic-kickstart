abstract = "Readability is a measure of how easy it is to read a text. Over time, general-interest journals have become more technical. This affects how accessible research is to a general audience. Our analysis looks at how readable abstracts are. We study the readability of abstracts of top five economics journals between 2000â€“2019. We collect the characteristics of the abstracts, papers, and authors of these papers. We find that abstracts with higher proportion of women co-authors are more readable. These results are robust to various readability measures and model specifications."
