abstract = "This paper develops the asymptotic theory for the estimation of smooth semiparametric generalized estimating equations models with weakly dependent data. The paper proposes new estimation methods based on smoothed two-step versions of the generalised method of moments and generalised empirical likelihood methods. An important aspect of the paper is that it allows the first-step estimation to have an effect on the asymptotic variances of the second-step estimators and explicitly characterises this effect for the empirically relevant case of the so-called generated regressors. The results of the paper are illustrated with a partially linear model that has not been previously considered in the literature. The proofs of the results utilise a new uniform strong law of large numbers and a new central limit theorem for $U$-statistics with varying kernels that are of independent interest."
