abstract = "The command netivreg implements the generalized three-stage least-squares estimator developed in Estrada (2022, _Causal inference in multilayered networks_, PhD thesis) and the generalized method of moments estimator in Chan et al. (2024, _Journal of Econometric Methods_ 13: 205-224) for the endogenous linear-in-means model. The two procedures use full observability of a two-layered multiplex network data structure using Stata’s new multiframes capabilities and Python integration (version 16 and above). Applications of the command include simulated data and three years’ worth of data on peer-reviewed articles published in top general-interest journals in economics."
