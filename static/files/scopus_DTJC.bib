abstract={This paper proposes a new semiparametric estimator of models where the response random variable is a fraction. The estimator is constructed by optimizing a semiparametric quasi-maximum likelihood that utilizes kernel smoothing.

We apply the method to publicly available monthly data on individual-good prices collected in retail stores by the UK Office for National Statistics for the construction of the UK Consumer Price Index from March 1996 to September 2015. In addition, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology. Our method allows us to visualize the dynamics of the price distribution and uncovers interesting patterns during the sample period. Further, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology with an out-of-sample forecasting algorithm which exploits the time dependence of distributions. Our out-of-sample forecasts compares favorably with the random walk forecast. © 2018, Institute of Mathematical Statistics. All rights reserved.},

abstract={In this paper we study the own-price elasticity for gasoline in demand systems involving three expenditure categories in the transportation sector in Canada: gasoline, local transportation, and intercity transportation for Canadian households from 1997 to 2009. In particular, we conduct a replication of Chang and Serletis, (The demand for gasoline: Evidence from household survey data, Journal of Applied Econometrics, 2014, 29, 291–343) hereafter CS, who—using TSP version 5.1—estimated Deaton and Muellbauer, 's Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) (American Economic Review, 1980, 70, 312–326), Banks et al., 's Quadratic AIDS (Review of Economics and Statistics, 1997, 79, 527–539), and Barnett, 's Minflex Laurent (ML) (Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 1983, 1, 7–23) models to demand systems consisting of these three goods, analyzing and enforcing theoretical economic regularity—that is, the compliance of estimates with positivity, monotonicity, and curvature. Using the R statistical language instead, we found that our estimates are similar to those of CS using data for single-member households and married couples without children, but differ for households with one child. (All replicated estimation tables in CS, as well as our full implementation, are available as supplementary material in the online version of this paper.) However, using a more flexible copula model, a total of 168 possible specifications for each type of household and their resulting gasoline own-price elasticities are also estimated. We find that allowing for skewness in the marginal distributions of local transportation budget shares greatly improves the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) of our models. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

We estimate ex ante the size of a collateral pool large enough to cover exposure for a historical worst-case default scenario. The parameters of the distribution of the maxima are estimated using two main statistical approaches based on extreme value models: Block-Maxima for different window lengths (daily, weekly and monthly) and Peak-over-Threshold. Our statistical model implies that the largest daily net debit position across participants exceeds roughly $1.5 billion once a year. Despite relying on extreme-value theory, the out of sample forecasts may still underestimate an actual exposure given the absence of observed data on defaults and financial stress in Canada. Our results are informative for optimal collateral management and system design of pre-funded retail-payment schemes. © 2018 Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag GmbH, Published by De Gruyter Oldenbourg, Berlin/Boston.},

An important aspect of the paper is that it allows the first-step estimation to have an effect on the asymptotic variances of the second-step estimators and explicitly characterises this effect for the empirically relevant case of the so-called generated regressors. The results of the paper are illustrated with a partially linear model that has not been previously considered in the literature.

The original study by Zimmer (2012) employs a finite-mixture copula to illustrate that the symmetry of the Gaussian copula may not be tenable, especially for US housing price data during the time period from 1975:Q2 to 2009:Q1. We undertake a replication of his study in a wide sense. First, we replicate the study by incorporating revised data and then extending the dataset to include the most recent data. Second, we implement a nonparametric copula estimator recently proposed by Racine ('Mixed data kernel copulas', Empirical Economics forthcoming) to the parametrically filtered data used in Zimmer (2012). Our replication finds that the application of the nonparametric copula to the same and extended filtered data provides an alternative flexible specification for copulas. However, the overall cautionary message of the flexible-form copula espoused in Zimmer (2012) remains. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

One advantage of aggregating the estimators rather than the moment conditions is that it yields robustness to certain types of parameter heterogeneity in the sense that it delivers consistent estimates of the mean effect in that case.

abstract={SUMMARY: crs is a library for R written by Jeffrey S. Racine (Maintainer) and Zhenghua Nie. This add-on package provides a collection of functions for spline-based nonparametric estimation of regression functions with both continuous and categorical regressors. Currently, the crs package integrates data-driven methods for selecting the spline degree, the number of knots and the necessary bandwidths for nonparametric conditional mean, IV and quantile regression. A function for multivariate density spline estimation with mixed data is also currently in the works. As a bonus, the authors have also provided the first simple R interface to the NOMAD ('nonsmooth mesh adaptive direct search') optimization solver which can be applied to solve other mixed integer optimization problems that future users might find useful in other settings. Although the crs package shares some of the same functionalities as its kernel-based counterpart-the np package by the same author-it currently lacks some of the features the np package provides, such as hypothesis testing and semiparametric estimation. However, what it lacks in breadth, crs makes up in speed. A Monte Carlo experiment in this review uncovers sizable speed gains compared to its np counterpart, with a marginal loss in terms of goodness of fit. Therefore, the package will be extremely useful for applied econometricians interested in employing nonparametric techniques using large amounts of data with a small number of discrete covariates. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

These nonparametric methods use functional principal components to describe these densities over time. This method is applied to a novel administrative firm-level database from Statistics Canada to investigate the evolution of the 1985 and 1989 cohorts of new entrants. We find that firm leverage (debt-to-asset ratio) distributions have persistent deviations from the initial distributions. Bootstrap test statistics suggest that the distributions are different across all time periods. Firm size and labour productivity have transitory deviations and some of the distributions are the same across all time periods. Univariate finite mixture and stochastic dominance tests are used to conduct pairwise comparisons as robustness measures. We find that these static pairwise comparisons confirm the dynamic evolution of these densities. This method illustrates the efficacy of functional principal components to analyse firm distributions. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This chapter extends the Monte Carlo results in Athey and Imbens's (2006) to assess the efficacy of the NL-DID estimators in finite samples. Furthermore, the NL-DID methodology recovers the entire outcome distribution in the absence of treatment. Further, we consider the empirical size and power of tests statistics for equality of mean, medians, and complete distributions as suggested by Abadie (2002). The results show that the NL-DID estimator can effectively be used to recover the average treatment effect, as well as the entire distribution of the treatment effects when there is no selection during the treatment period in finite samples.

abstract={This article investigates the evolution of firm distributions for entrant manufacturing firms in Canada using functional principal components analysis. This methodology describes the dynamics of firms by examining production variables, size, and labor productivity, and a financial variable, leverage (debt-to-asset ratio). We adapt the canonical functional principal components analysis to allow for the inclusion of qualitative information in the form of discrete variables, industry, and region, to capture market structure differences, which is shown to change the dynamics of firm size and labor productivity distributions only. We also perform various tests with the null hypothesis that the distributions are equal across time. When accounting for industry and regional categories, there is a substantial fall in the number of rejections of the null hypothesis of equality for size and labor productivity, which is not the case for leverage. These results show the importance of including qualitative information to account for potential heterogeneity when applying functional principal component analysis to firm-level data. Finally, the methodology finds a correlation between the evolution of variable distributions and macroeconomic factors.

abstract={This paper characterizes the bandwidth value (h) that is optimal for estimating parameters of the form η = E [ω/fV|U (V|U), where the conditional density of a scalar continuous random variable V, given a random vector U, fV|U, is replaced by its kernel estimator. That is, the parameter η is the expectation of ω inversely weighted by f V|U, and it is the building block of various semiparametric estimators already proposed in the literature such as Lewbel (1998), Lewbel (2000b), Honoré and Lewbel (2002), Khan and Lewbel (2007), and Lewbel (2007). The optimal bandwidth is derived by minimizing the leading terms of a second-order mean squared error expansion of an in-probability approximation of the resulting estimator with respect to h. The expansion also demonstrates that the bandwidth can be chosen on the basis of bias alone, and that a simple "plug-in" estimator for the optimal bandwidth can be constructed. Finally, the small sample performance of our proposed estimator of the optimal bandwidth is assessed by a Monte Carlo experiment. © Cambridge University Press, 2009.},

In this chapter we illustrate, through a variety of empirical examples, how modelers handle the complexities that arise from the richness of survey data and the heterogeneity in behavior of market participants. After introductory sections on data and programming languages, the remainder of the chapter covers many leading computationally intensive econometric techniques.
