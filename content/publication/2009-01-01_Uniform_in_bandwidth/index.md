abstract = "We prove the strong consistency, uniformly in the bandwidth, of the smooth varying coefficient conditional least squares estimator. Our results justify data-driven choices of bandwidths, such as Silverman's rule-of thumb, or standard cross-validation, that are usually implemented by most practitioners."
