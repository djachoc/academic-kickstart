abstract={We document rich variation across observed firms' characteristics, and the accompanying macroeconomic volatility, often related to political turmoil for Ukrainian manufacturing firms. We use a unique annual firm-level data for the period from 2001 to 2009 compiled from the Derzhkomstat. To understand the evolution of distributions we utilize functional principal component analysis while accounting for the effects associated with firms' region, industry, trade status, and firm turnover. The overall improvements in firm productivity in Ukraine's manufacturing in 2001-2009 vary substantially by industry, trade status and with firm turnover, while regional effects are less important.
